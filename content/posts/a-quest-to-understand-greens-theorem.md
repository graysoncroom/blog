## Introduction

Green's Theorem never really made sense to me.

My first introduction to Green's Theorem was in my first sememester of
university in a course called
[Calculus of Several Variables](
    https://catalog.utdallas.edu/2019/undergraduate/courses/math2415
). The statement of the theorem wasn't overly complicated, but I just couldn't
put it all together and see the big picture.

A couple years passed without seeing it again. Most of my coursework in this time
was more focused on CS courses, Algebra, and intro-to-proof type courses.

Then in my junior year, it came up again in my [Multivariable Calculus]() course,
which covered the calculus of functions:
$$f : \mathbf{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^n \text{ s.t. } f \in C^\infty$$
I understood it better this time around, but there was still something missing.

It wasn't until I volunteered for the undergrad TA position for that same
Calc. course I took in my first semester
