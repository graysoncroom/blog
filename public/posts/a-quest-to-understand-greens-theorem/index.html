<p>Green&rsquo;s Theorem never really made sense to me.</p>
<p>My first introduction to Green&rsquo;s Theorem was in my first sememester of
university in a course called
<a href="https://catalog.utdallas.edu/2019/undergraduate/courses/math2415">Calculus of Several Variables</a>. The statement of the theorem wasn&rsquo;t overly complicated, but I just couldn&rsquo;t
put it all together and see the big picture.</p>
<p>A couple years passed without seeing it again. Most of my coursework in this time
was more focused on CS courses, Algebra, and intro-to-proof type courses.</p>
<p>Then in my junior year, it came up again in my <a href="">Multivariable Calculus</a> course,
which covered the calculus of functions:
$$f : \mathbf{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^n \text{ s.t. } f \in C^\infty$$
I understood it better this time around, but there was still something missing.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until I volunteered for the undergrad TA position for that same
Calc. course I took in my first semester</p>
