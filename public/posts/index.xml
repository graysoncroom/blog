      <description>Introduction Green&amp;rsquo;s Theorem never really made sense to me.
My first introduction to Green&amp;rsquo;s Theorem was in my first sememester of university in a course called Calculus of Several Variables. The statement of the theorem wasn&amp;rsquo;t overly complicated, but I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t put it all together and see the big picture.
A couple years passed without seeing it again. Most of my coursework in this time was more focused on CS courses, Algebra, and intro-to-proof type courses.</description>
