      <description>Introduction When I was first introduced to the idea of injectivity, the definition felt rather arbitrary and unmotivated. Conceptually, when a function is injective it means that it is one-to-one, or that it maps every element in its domain to exactly one element in its codomain.
This is (and was) a clear statement, but my confusion stemed from the way that we formalize this concept in the language of mathematics.</description>
