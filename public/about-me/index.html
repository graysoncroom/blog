<h3 id="my-story">My Story</h3>
<h4 id="first-real-interest">First Real Interest</h4>
<p>My first real experiences with computers came from hacking around on my old Thinkpad T420
running Fedora 24 (still to this day my favorite laptop).
I was obsessed with how computers worked which led me to wanting to learn as much as
I could about Linux.
Pretty early on in my highschool years, I started learning how to program in order to write
various automation tasks for my laptop.
Long story short, I ended up loving programming languages and landed my first internship at a
company called <a href="">WebCreek</a> in the 10th grade.</p>
<h4 id="school">School</h4>
<p>I hated school and was terrible at math.
In hindsight, my mathematical maturity wasn&rsquo;t at the level of my peers and none of the topics we
were learning about were properly motivated.
However, many people in my life told me that math would become important if I were to continue
studying Computer Science, and this motivated me enough
to give it the attention it deserved.
It took a while to catch up, but by my senior year I started to actually enjoy the subject.
The concepts of infinity introduced in my AP Calculus BC course were absolutely fascinating and
I always wanted to understand exactly why these things were true.</p>
<h4 id="early-university">Early University</h4>
<p>In my first semester of university, I took a course called <a href="">Calculus of Several Variables</a>
because the idea of not taking a math course felt rather odd to me. Moreover, there
were a lot of mysteries in Calculus that I hadn&rsquo;t yet solved, and I fully intended to
get to the bottom of it all.</p>
<p>This course had a required &ldquo;math lab&rdquo; which was a two-hour block of time each week
where students met up and solved problems under the supervision of a graduate and
an undergraduate TA. This graduate TA completely shattered my conception of math by
showing me that mathematics is the study of abstractions themselves, which live in
a world of their own and can be reasoned about, using nothing but logic, from this one.</p>
<p>More and more, I started to view math the way I viewed an elegant piece of code.
Eventually, I came to see mathematics as the more beautiful and interesting subject
of the two.</p>
<p>There were more people that influenced the direction my life took (my high school Calculus and Physics teachers come to mind)
but this is enough to give readers a good idea of my journey from troublemaker to
aspiring mathematician.</p>
